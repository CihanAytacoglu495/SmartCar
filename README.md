# Smart Car Bulid With NodeMcu
**Smart Car Application**

*The general purpose of this project is to create a smart tool module using nodemcu esp8266. In the project, the esp8266 wifi libraries are integrated and the motors connected to the motor driver take action according to the methods sent, thanks to the http get methods over the internet.
The project has an android application, and this application was designed by MIT application inventor.
The esp module was used as a distribution point in the esp8266 library we used in the project.
As soon as we power the esp module, we can connect to the distributed wifi point thanks to this library.
Afterwards, we connect our android device to this point and enter the apk application that we have created via "MIT application inventor".
Finally, after entering the application, we press the arrow signs designed according to which direction we want to move our smart vehicle.*
